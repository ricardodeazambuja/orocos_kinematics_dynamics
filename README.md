# orocos_kinematics_dynamics

I have this fork for one simple thing: make PyKDL work with [the docker image I created](https://ricardodeazambuja.com/deep_learning/2019/01/31/tuning_tensorflow_docker_updated/).  

It's done all [inside a Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ricardodeazambuja/orocos_kinematics_dynamics/blob/master/python_orocos_kdl/Compiling%20PyKDL%20for%20Python3.ipynb) because that's the easier way if you are using the docker image I linked above.
